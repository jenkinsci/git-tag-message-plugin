<div>
  If the revision checked out has a git tag associated with it, the tag name
  will be exported during the build as <strong><tt>GIT_TAG_NAME</tt></strong>.
  <br/>
  If a message was specified when creating the tag, then that message will be
  exported during the build as the <strong><tt>GIT_TAG_MESSAGE</tt></strong>
  environment variable.
  <br/>
  If no tag message was specified, the commit message will be used.
  <br/>
  If you ticked the <strong>Use most recent tag</strong> option, and the revision checked out has
  no git tag associated with it, the parent commits will be searched for a git tag,
  and the rules stated above will apply to the first parent commit with a git tag.
  <p/>
  If the revision has more than one tag associated with it, only the most recent
  tag will be taken into account, <strong>unless</strong> the refspec contains
  "refs/tags/" &mdash; i.e. builds are only triggered when certain tag names or
  patterns are matched &mdash; in which case the exact tag name that triggered
  the build will be used, even if it's not the most recent tag for this commit.
  <br/>
  For this reason, if you're not using a tag-specific refspec but you
  <em>are</em> using the "Create a tag for every build" behaviour, you should
  make sure that the build-tagging behaviour is configured to run <em>after</em>
  this "export git tag message" behaviour.
  <p/>
  Tag and commit messages which span multiple lines are no problem, though only
  the first 10000 lines of a tag's message will be exported.
